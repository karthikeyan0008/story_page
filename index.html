The Murugan Temple located here is considered to be the seventh abode of Lord Murugan. This temple is about 1200 years old and is under the patronage of Arunagirinathar with Thiruppugal. There are references to this temple in the inscriptions in the temple at Thirumuruganpoondi. Adjacent to the temple is the Pambatti Siddhar Cave Temple. Like other temples dedicated to Lord Murugan, the Marudhamalai Temple is located on the top of a hill in the Western Ghats.Pambatti Siddhar, blessed by Murugan Lord, carved a new idol for Murugan at Maruthamalai. This idol of Lord Murugan has two arms, just like the Palani Murugan, with an anklet in his right hand and a left arm at his waist. At the back of the head is a ponytail (Kudumi). He wears an anklet on his feet.

Daily he will appear before his devotees in three decorations: royal ornaments, vibudhi kappu and sandalwood. On special days like Karthigai and Thaipoosam, he wears golden armour. Only in Arthajama Puja can he be seen in a self-portrait as a Dandayuthapani, where he wears only the veil, without any ornament or crown.According to history, Pambatti Sidhhar is a saint. He used to catch the poisonous snakes and remove their poison from his childhood. He also used to prepare medicines to cure such bites. The people call him a snake doctor. One day he comes to this place to find a snake with a gem.

A rishi says to him that the purpose of life is to find the snake in you and control it through yoga. He said what he is doing now is a waste of time. The saint began to meditate upon Lord Murugan. The Lord Murugan gave darshan to the saint.
